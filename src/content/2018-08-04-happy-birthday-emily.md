Happy Birthday! Your ability to capture a moment in writing is simply inspiring and I've been so impressed with what a talented writer you are. Traveling the world together and sharing wonderful experiences has always been a top priority for us, and now we can share it with the world. I think its one of the big reasons we fell in love with each other, our shared passion for adventure. JemAdventures was once an idea, but now it's a real thing! On top of writing, you've learned how to manage web content just like this. Our book is filling quickly and we need to transition to something without limits! This site is built with WordPress so you'll already be a pro! There's nothing I enjoy more than sharing this passion with you and now this project will allow us to look back on every detail! The best gift I can give is a liftetime of adventures. Now we have somewhere special to keep them.

I love you so much!

You're bug,

James
