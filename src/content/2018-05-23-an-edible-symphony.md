_“Food is music to the body; music is food to the heart.”—Gregory David Roberts_ 

We had the most magnificent meal at the Michelin Star restaurant Étude—and it was 100% vegan! The courses, called Symphony, were inspired by Chopin’s études for the piano:

What I savored most was the asparagus! Spring is asparagus season, and thick bundles of green and white tender stalks are seen at every farmer's market and on the menu of restaurants. This succulent feast is a tribute to seasonal vegetables, fruits, and herbs, sourced daily from local producers. Flavoring the dishes are virgin almond, walnut, hazelnut and pistachio oils, in substitute of dairy. We were even served a peanut brioche with a creamy emulsion of olive oil and cardamom, instead of butter!

The courses paired perfectly with Champagne from the famous wine region. Michelin inspectors sum up the feast exquisitely: “Nourished by his meetings with small-scale producers, by the discovery of ingredients from afar—pepper from Taiwan with citrus notes, Iranian berries—the chef, Keisuke Yamagishi, cooks here like a tightrope walker, offering set menus named 'Symphonie,' 'Ballade,' 'Prélude' in homage to Chopin. Each dish is a masterclass in harmony.”

Bon appétit!
