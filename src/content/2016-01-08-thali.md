Today was one of the most memorable days of my life. It was one of those days that started out slow, but got better and better, ending in an evening of pure joy. We had Kalari class in the morning and a question and answer session with Sir. The Kalari helped loosen up my sore muscles from the day before, and our last class ended with peaceful meditation. For lunch, they served a very special dessert, typically given out at temples, nae paidum (rice pudding with jaggery).

We left Gurukulam for Bangalore, to see the Bangalore Fort, Tipu’s Palace, and a Vishnu temple. We went shopping on the commercial street, and I purchased two beautiful cashmere scarves, one deep orange for my grandma, and the other purple and gold for Aunt Jean. My professor's mother, Chandrika, knew how to haggle! I also got bangles! They had rows and rows of them, of every color imaginable, sparkling silvery blues and lilacs, emerald greens, deep pinks spotted with gold, and vibrant oranges encrusted with glittering gems.

Then I sat down for dinner with some of the most stimulating conversation and enticing food I have ever had. Chandrika, her sister-in-law Ragi, and I talked of love, arranged marriages, religion, globalization, colonization, and independence, the increasing amount of women entering the workforce, divorce, caste, tradition in the face of modernity, a revaluing of traditional Indian culture over Western, nonprofits, animals and the environment, careers, parenting, weddings, travel, and “the olden days”. These two women I sat with were wise beyond their years, and I felt so honored to be able to share a meal with them.

As we went through the thali they explained each dish, citing relevant details about many of them. "Khus was a cooling sweet drink made of the vetiver root, and in summer they use bundles of the roots to freshen water coolers," Chandrika noted. “Grandma had rolling shades of the root so it cools the whole house—a natural air conditioner."

Sweets are very popular in India, Ragi said. “During Diwali, in the olden days, we used to make baskets of sweets and give them to other families, and other families would give them to us, so our fridge would be stocked for a month.”

Their advice on love? “People fall out of love so easily. I think when you have been married for a long time, it’s more about a mutual respect. I had an arranged marriage myself, my parents said it was okay if I met someone in college but I just didn’t find anyone.”

The night ended with a conversation with the vice president of Twitter. We discussed how technology is rapidly becoming the future, and she agreed with me that robots would soon become part of everyday life. I told her about my dad’s big data research on Twitter feed!

As always, meals shared in India led to fascinating conversations about the culture, memories, history, and new perspectives.
