_"Traveling—it leaves you speechless, then turns you into a storyteller"_ —Ibn Battuta

After graduating from Brighton High School at 17, I prepared for a year full of adventures. I knew there would be many firsts as I set out to travel solo to Africa that fall, and I was filled with excitement.  Some questioned whether taking a gap year was a smart thing to do. They gave me a look with raised eyes or bluntly told me that if I am taking that much time off now, there was no way I'd ever go back to school. But I knew I was going to reaffirm my passions. I had such a curiosity about other cultures and places, and the urgency of it couldn't wait four more years of college before setting out into the real world. I wanted to actively explore my interests in the field, see and experience first hand what a potential career could be. And so I went. Without any hesitation, without a doubt. I had no idea what to expect, and I was a bit nervous traveling by myself through a foreign country for the first time, but the overall feeling was a resounding sense of calm, as I followed a path I had been longing for and dreaming of. Everything felt right, no matter what others thought. The time was now.

My parents could not have been more supportive. I remember the day I told my mom, "I'm not ready for college," while driving to school. I had looked at so many universities, and still, I was unsure. No place felt like just the right fit. When she brought up the concept of a gap year, I knew immediately that that was what I wanted to do.

And so I joined on as a volunteer with the organization African Impact in the fall of 2012. On the first leg of my journey, I spent a month as a photography and conservation volunteer in Zululand, South Africa. I met people from all over the world: Singapore, Sweden, Australia, Ireland, Panama, and fellow Americans. All brought unique points of view but were united by a common love of animals. We began our placement with a four-day workshop on wildlife photography. Working with the photography teacher was extremely helpful. We critiqued each other's work, and he taught us so much about how to get the best quality photo when shooting wildlife. The first night we were lucky enough to find a leopard, and driving back on the game truck fireflies lit up the surrounding bush. The thunderstorms were incredible: huge streaks of lightning flashed across the purple sky as thunder rumbled continuously. On one of our last game drives, we had a second sighting of leopards! We stayed in the rain as darkness enfolded us, listening to the leopards’ mating call. The next day we were right in the middle of an elephant herd. We watched as they passed by within a few inches of our truck, one a calf only six months old. The animals were breathtaking and the opportunities to learn were endless. The overall highlight of my stay was seeing my first kill. A pride of lions surrounded a wildebeest and took it down with one swift leap and a bite. Their sheer power made me realize how truly magnificent these animals are and how hard we must work to ensure their survival.

During my stay, I had the opportunity to work in the community at two different preschools. In an area where AIDS runs rampant, many people are unable to care for their children. The children I worked with smothered me with love. They are so playful and energetic, eyes shining with curiosity and eagerness to learn. We helped teach English, prepared food and organized games outdoors.

This captivating experience prepared me for the next leg of my journey: volunteering for a month at a lion conservation program in Antelope Park near Gweru, Zimbabwe. In the midst of political struggle under a brutal dictator, where the unemployment level was close to 85 percent, the people were warm and welcoming. I met amazing staff, guides, and volunteers and heard their fascinating stories. I had many altering experiences: walking to different areas of the city where street kids lived, searching for injured and sick children. Swimming on horseback through crocodile infested waters. Helping a woman and her baby at a medical clinic, both covered in terrible burns from hot cooking oil. Connecting deeply with a girl I met at the orphanage, who became my pen pal. Helping with the sedation and transport of a pair of lions. Taking care of a newborn foal and her mother. Being given an abandoned one-month old antelope with pneumonia to care for, but having to accept it would likely die. Feeding orphaned elephants. Walking across the savanna surrounded by lion cubs and animals on all sides. Attending an African wedding—the list goes on. I was even able to help assist the Antelope Park photographer, which I largely owe to the experience I gained in South Africa.

From these experiences, I had a broader sense of the suffering that goes on in the world, but also of the impact people can have when they believe strongly enough in a cause. I became even more confident in myself and committed to work to bring about change in the world. Everyone I met was so open and friendly, despite what might have been going on in their lives and I was resolved to emulate their positive outlook on life. I realized that there is beauty everywhere, in every step we take down the path of life and we only have to open our eyes to find it and appreciate it. I learned to savor each moment and grow from each experience. I have a much greater appreciation for what I had growing up and of the life I have before me. The people, the places, the wildlife—all were stunning and magnificent and powerful. **Traveling to Africa reinforced my love of wildlife and strengthened my resolve to pursue my passions whole-heartedly.**

After hostessing at a pizzeria when I got home that winter and spending Christmas with my family, I was off again to Southeast Asia. On my program was the girl who would become my best friend, Emma. She and I were two of ten teens in the program, and we both happened to be from Rochester, New York. She had even attended Allendale Columbia, a small private school that I had gone to for my freshman and sophomore year, during her senior year, so we had many friends in common and had met one time previously at a graduation party.

During my gap year, I heard for the first time about Colorado College, a small liberal arts school with a hands-on curriculum. It was tough to get into, with an acceptance rate of 15%, but I hoped my experiences in the field over the past year would showcase that I was the type of student they were seeking. I got in. I pursued a B.A. in Anthropology, and took courses with numerous excursions, from classes abroad in India and Italy to field trips to the Pueblos of New Mexico. It was in a small coffee shop near the school, during my junior year, that I met my future husband to be, James! The day before, we had matched on a dating app—as soon as he saw photos of me caring for an elephant in Africa and gazing out at golden stupas in Myanmar, he swiped right!

The spring of my senior year, I began looking for jobs in the travel industry. I stumbled across Natural Habitat Adventures online, and lo and behold, they were located in Boulder! As I began researching them more, I was amazed. A wildlife travel company, with trips all over the world, and the partner of World Wildlife Fund—what more could I ask for? I found my perfect fit in their Marketing Department, writing blogs and website content about animals and travel. Three years later, I now work for World Wildlife Fund itself, helping inspire people to protect our planet. **I firmly believe that my travel experiences during my gap year helped me achieve both my acceptance into the perfect college and garner my dream job.** Taking a gap year, despite the initial hesitations from many, has been reaffirming in so many ways, time and again. I cannot recommend enough that if you or your child does not yet feel ready to go to college, that taking some time to reassess and confirm your passions is completely okay!
